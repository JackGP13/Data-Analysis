# Data Science Projects

## Multiple projects, including:
1. Text pre-processing for GPTs. This project demonstrates how to preprocess textual data for use in training or fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM). 
The goal is to clean, normalize, and tokenize input text to prepare it as features for the model. 
Uses Python with libraries such as PyTorch and the `re` module for regular expression operations.

2. Multivariate Linear Regression of marathon training data. This project uses my real world data to evaluate which dependent variables most influence the pace of running during training. 

### Prerequisites
Uses following Python packages:
- PyTorch: For handling tensors and neural network models.
- `re`: Python's built-in module for working with Regular Expressions.
