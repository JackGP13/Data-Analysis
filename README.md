# Project Overview
Welcome to my Data Analysis repository! This collection of projects showcases various data analysis tasks I've undertaken using R and Python programming languages utilizing Jupyter Notebooks. The datasets used in these projects come from a mix of sources (listed below), including personal data.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into multiple folders, each containing a separate project:

Diamond Analysis: Analysis of Diamonds.csv using R and jupyter notebooks to predict the price of a diamond
Rivian Marketing Analysis: Exploratory data analysis using R and jupyter notebooks to examine demand curve for Rivian EVs
Marathon Training Analysis: Manually exported apple health data analyzed with python and jupyter notebooks to predict marathon race pace
...
## Datasets Used
Some datasets used in these projects are sourced from online repositories, while others are based on personal experience. The following online sources were used:

Kaggle Datasets
Survey Data provided by marketing firm (not allowed to disclose which)
My own Apple Health data

For more information on the specific datasets used for each project, please refer to their respective README files or documentation.

## Software Requirements
To run and view the code for these projects, you'll need:

R (version 3.6.1 or later) with necessary packages installed (dplyr, glmnet, randomforest, etc.)
Python (version 3.12.9 or later) with necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.)
Jupyter Notebook

# Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Install required software and packages as mentioned above.
For R projects, create a new R environment and install necessary packages using install.packages() commands in the console.
For Python projects, activate the relevant Python environment using conda or similar package managers.

# Project Documentation
Each project contains its own README file with more detailed information on:

# Project objectives
Data sources and processing steps
Analysis methodology
Results and findings
Please consult these individual README files for specific details about each project.

# Contributions and Feedback
Feel free to fork this repository, contribute your own projects or datasets, or provide feedback on existing work. I'm always interested in discussing data analysis approaches and learning from others!

Note: This is just a starting point, and you can customize it as needed for your specific projects and workflow. Good luck with your GitHub repository!
